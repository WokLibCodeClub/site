                    Can you complete the code to make a times table tester that will give you an output like this?

                    <img src="times_table1.png" alt="Output of times table tester" class="inline" width="486" height="318"/>
                    <br><br>
                    Start by working out the code to calculate the correct value of the variable <code>correct_answer</code> then put in
                    lines to print the variables <code>times_table</code>, <code>rand_num</code> and <code>correct_answer</code> 
                    just to check your code is working. (You can comment out these lines later.)
                    <br><br>
                    Then you need to use the <code>input()</code> function to ask the question, using the variables <code>times_table</code> and 
                    <code>rand_num</code>. Then you need an <code>if</code> block to check if the user has typed in the correct answer. The code
                    needs to give a different response depending on whether the user got the right answer or not.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Be careful!!</b> You have to keep in mind the <i>type</i> of the variables - which means whether they are <i>integer</i> 
                    type or <i>string</i> type, and you will have to convert some numbers from integer to string and some from string to integer to 
                    prevent errors!

                    Here you have to write code to get a Python turtle through a zig-zag course. Click on Run to show the course.
                    <br><br>
                    Your turtle has to start on the red square and get to the green square. Make sure it draws a line behind it as it goes, 
                    but beware, the line is not allowed to cross any of the black space.
                    <br><br>
                    You are trying to write the shortest code possible. You are allowed as many lines as you want to set up your turtle, set its
                    initial heading, colour and position. The counting begins with your code to move the turtle from the red square.
                    <br><br>
                    Can you beat the record of 11 lines of code??????

                    This challenge is all about Python lists.
                    <br><br>
                    A Python list consists of a series of items, separated by commas, inside square brackets <code>[]</code>.
                    Lists are very closely associated with Python <code>for</code> loops and some of these challenges will also include writing loops.
                    <br><br>
                    There are three lists - you have to find different ways of printing out all the contents.

                    <br><br>
                    The first instruction is to copy the four lines of code 
                    which are highlighted, and paste these in above the line which says <code>screen.update()</code>. In the <i>pasted</i> code change 
                    the turtle's fill colour to <code>'red'</code> and put in a different heading until you get a green arrow and a red arrow point to 
                    point like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate2.png" alt="Head-to-head arrows" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    Both arrows have their points at coordinates (x, y) and you will see that in the code x and y are both set to 0. But now you have to 
                    adjust the coordinates for the red arrow so that the bottom sloping edge of the red arrow lines up exactly with the top sloping edge 
                    of the green arrow, like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate3.png" alt="Tesselated arrows" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    You can do this by changing the goto() instruction for the red arrow to <code>a.goto(x - ?, y + ?)</code> but you need to work out
                    what numbers to put in in place of the question marks. You can check you have the right numbers by changing the values
                    of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> near the top of the code, and check that the two arrows move together to whatever
                    location you choose.
                    <br><br>
                    Now we've got code to draw two joined arrow shapes we need to put all this code (nine lines in all) inside a <i>function</i>.
                    Start your function with this line:
                    <br>
                    <code>def tile(x, y):</code>
                    <br>
                    above the line which says <code>a.fillcolor('lightgreen')</code> and make sure the nine lines which are going inside the function
                    are <i>indented</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    Just having a function won't do anything - we need to <i>call</i> the function. At the end of the code put the line
                    <br>
                    <code>tile(  ,  )</code>
                    <br>
                    with two numbers inside the brackets which are the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the point where you 
                    want to draw the arrows.
                    <br><br>
                    Now call the function again (add another line after the last one) but this time with the <code>x</code> coordinate 100 
                    more than it was before. Then add a third function call with the <code>x</code> coordinate 100 more again. You should 
                    end up with a picture looking similar to this:
                </p>
                <div height: 200px>
                    <span class='hor-block'>
                        <img src="tesselate4.png" width="200" height="200"/>
                    </span>
                    <span class='hor-block'>
                        (In fact your screen will look exactly like this if you have your first function call at coordinates (0, 0).)
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    What you need now is to set the starting x coordinate to a position at the left edge of the screen, and have it increase in jumps of 
                    100 until it goes beyond the right edge of the screen, calling the <code>tile(x,y)</code> function for each jump. You can do 
                    this using a Python <code>for</code> loop with a <code>range()</code> function where you put <i>three</i> numbers inside
                    the brackets.
                    <br><br>
                    Once you have a <code>for</code> loop which draws the double-arrow pattern all across the screen you then need <i>another</i>
                    <code>for</code> loop to do the same thing for the <code>y</code> coordinate (again using the <code>range()</code> function
                    with <i>three</i> numbers inside the brackets, except the size of the jump will be different).
                    <br><br>
                    The clever trick is the put the x-coordinate <code>for</code> loop <i><b>inside</b></i> the y-coordinate <code>for</code> loop.
                    This will give the arrow pattern filling the whole screen!

                </h2>
            
                <p>
                    Here is a more interesting tesselation picture to create:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate14.png" alt="Rhombus tesselation" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    You can use almost exactly the same approach here as you did with the previous tesselation challenge.
                    <br><br>
                    But now we have three turtle shapes, called <code>'diamond'</code>, <code>'left_rhombus'</code> and <code>'right_rhombus'</code>,  
                    and they need to be drawn using three different <b><i>fill</i></b> colours (that's the colour that goes inside the turtle) while the 
                    <b><i>pen</i></b> colour (which is the colour of the outline) remains the same. This diagram shows the three shapes drawn together, 
                    while the turtle stays at coordinates (0, 0) and using the colours <code>'white'</code> for the diamond, <code>'lightgrey'</code> for 
                    the rhombus on the left and <code>'dimgrey'</code> for the rhombus on the right. The diagram also shows the dimensions in pixels of 
                    the different parts of the shapes. 
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate10a.png" alt="Dimensions of rhombus shapes" class="inline" width="300" height="300"/>
                    <br><br>
                    If you run the code it will draw the turtle showing the <code>'diamond'</code> shape, with fill colour 'white' at coordinates (0,0).
                    The first instruction is to copy the three lines of code highlighted by the comment, and paste these three lines <i>twice</i>.
                    In the first three pasted lines you will change the turtle shape to <code>'left_rhombus'</code> and the turtle fill colour to 
                    <code>'lightgrey'</code>, and in the second three pasted lines you will change the turtle shape to <code>'right_rhombus'</code> and 
                    the turtle fill colour to <code>'dimgrey'</code>.
                    <br><br>
                    Run the code and you should now see a display like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate11.png" alt="Three rhombus shapes" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    As in the previous tesselation challenge you now need to take the 11 lines of code, starting with the line
                    <br>
                    <code>t.goto(0,0)</code>
                    <br>
                    and the three lines you copied, and the six lines you pasted and the line with the code <code>screen.update()</code> 
                    and turn these into a <b>function</b>. Start the function with the code:
                    <br>
                    <code>def draw_three_shapes(x,y):</code>
                    <br>
                    and change the coordinates in the <code>t.goto(0,0)</code> line to <code>t.goto(x,y)</code>. Don't forget to <b><i>indent</i></b>
                    all the lines which are inside the function.
                    <br><br>
                    In the section 'main code' <b><i>call</i></b> your function with the coordinates (0,0) and check you still see the same display.
                    <br><br>
                    Now you need to put your code to call the function inside a <code>for</code> loop so it repeats with a changing <code>x</code> 
                    coordinate. Use a <code>range()</code> function as you did before, but you will have to work out the three numbers to put in
                    the brackets. Try to get your code to draw a picture like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate12.png" alt="Shapes acrosss screen" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    Now made a <code>for</code> loop for the <code>y</code> coordinate, and put the loop for the <code>x</code> coordinate <i>inside</i> 
                    this loop. Use <code>range()</code> with three numbers in the brackets and try to get the screen looking like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate13.png" alt="Shapes acrosss/up screen" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    Both arrows have their points at coordinates (x, y) and you will see that in the code x and y are both set to 0. But now you have to 
                    adjust the coordinates for the red arrow so that the bottom sloping edge of the red arrow lines up exactly with the top sloping edge 
                    of the green arrow, like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="tesselate3.png" alt="Tesselated arrows" class="inline" width="200" height="200"/>
                    <br><br>
                    You can do this by changing the goto() instruction for the red arrow to <code>a.goto(x - ?, y + ?)</code> but you need to work out
                    what numbers to put in in place of the question marks. You can check you have the right numbers by changing the values
                    of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> near the top of the code, and check that the two arrows move together to whatever
                    location you choose.
                    <br><br>
                    Now we've got code to draw two joined arrow shapes we need to put all this code (nine lines in all) inside a <i>function</i>.
                    Start your function with this line:
                    <br>
                    <code>def tile(x, y):</code>
                    <br>
                    above the line which says <code>a.fillcolor('lightgreen')</code> and make sure the nine lines which are going inside the function
                    are <i>indented</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    Just having a function won't do anything - we need to <i>call</i> the function. At the end of the code put the line
                    <br>
                    <code>tile(  ,  )</code>
                    <br>
                    with two numbers inside the brackets which are the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the point where you 
                    want to draw the arrows.
                    <br><br>
                    Now call the function again (add another line after the last one) but this time with the <code>x</code> coordinate 100 
                    more than it was before. Then add a third function call with the <code>x</code> coordinate 100 more again. You should 
                    end up with a picture looking similar to this:
                </p>
                <div height: 200px>
                    <span class='hor-block'>
                        <img src="tesselate4.png" width="200" height="200"/>
                    </span>
                    <span class='hor-block'>
                        (In fact your screen will look exactly like this if you have your first function call at coordinates (0, 0).)
                    </span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    What you need now is to set the starting x coordinate to a position at the left edge of the screen, and have it increase in jumps of 
                    100 until it goes beyond the right edge of the screen, calling the <code>tile(x,y)</code> function for each jump. You can do 
                    this using a Python <code>for</code> loop with a <code>range()</code> function where you put <i>three</i> numbers inside
